# IoT_RoBo_Car
This project developed an obstacle avoiding robot to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. The robot is built on the Arduino platform for data processing and its software counterpart helps to communicate with the robot to send parameters for guiding movement. For obstacle detection, one ultrasonic distance sensor and two infrared sensors were used that provided a wider field of detection. The robot is fully autonomous and after the initial loading of the code, it requires no user intervention during its operation. When placed in an unknown environment with obstacles, it moved while avoiding all obstacles with considerable accuracy. A successful implementation of a person follower robot is done. This robot does not only have the detection capability but also the tracking and following ability as well. The tracking is basically performed on the tag and the human is followed on the basis of that detection. It was also kept in mind that the “following” capability of the robot should be as efficient as possible. The tests were performed on the different conditions to pinpoint the mistakes.
